# üìö Picking the Perfect Model: What Fits Your Data Best?

Welcome to the repository for the **"Picking the Perfect Model"** workshop!  
This session is all about understanding **how to choose** the right machine learning model based on your data, and comparing different models using cross-validation.

This repo contains a **Google Colab notebook** that walks you through:
- Fitting multiple ML models
- Evaluating models using cross-validation
- Comparing performances with metrics and visualizations
- Learning how to pick the best model for your specific problem!

## üõ†Ô∏è Workshop Contents

In this tutorial, we cover:
- **Loading a Dataset**: Using the popular **Digits** dataset from `scikit-learn`
- **Data Exploration**: Basic inspection and understanding of the data
- **Training Multiple Models**:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree Classifier
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- **Cross-Validation**: Using 5-Fold Cross Validation to evaluate models
- **Result Analysis**:
  - Calculating mean accuracy and standard deviation
  - Understanding model stability and generalization
  - Visual comparison of model performances

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Open the Colab Notebook by pressing the "Open in Colab" button on the top left.  
2. Follow along with the code and explanations.
3. Run the code cells to see how different models perform.
4. Try adjusting hyperparameters and re-running the cross-validation for practice!

## üß† Prerequisites

Make sure you have a basic understanding of:
- Python programming
- Machine Learning concepts like supervised learning (classification)

You'll also need the following libraries (already available in Colab):

```python
scikit-learn
numpy
matplotlib
```

## üìà What You'll Learn

- How to train and evaluate multiple machine learning models
- How **cross-validation** helps prevent overfitting and ensures reliable evaluation
- How to **compare models** based on their performance and stability
- How to **interpret mean accuracy** and **standard deviation** (¬±) correctly
- How to start thinking about model selection based on your problem and dataset characteristics

## üìã About the Dataset

We are using the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset** from `sklearn.datasets`, which consists of:
- 569 samples of tumor cells
- Each sample has 30 numeric features describing characteristics of the cell nuclei (e.g., radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, etc.)
- The task is to classify the tumors into two classes: **Benign** or **Malignant**.

This dataset is commonly used for binary classification tasks and is excellent for practicing model selection and evaluation techniques!
